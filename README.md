# Security Curriculum Spanish (constant changing)
This curriculum will be created for spanish speakers and it's in constant changes (Sept 11,2023).

The goal for this curriculum is to create a plan to improve the people's security in the virtual era, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). I am using some of their frameworks to help navigate through the different steps of analyzing cybersecurity incidents and response, risks and integrate my analysis into a general security strategy:




* Identity:
  * Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 

* Protect:
  * Internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 

* Detect:
  * Detecting potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 

* Respond:
  * To contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 

* Recover:
  * Affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.
